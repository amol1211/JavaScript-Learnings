Values and Variables

Variables naming conventions :

1. The first character must be a letter or an underscore(_) or an dollar sign($). You can't use number as first character.

2. The rest of the variable name can include any letter, any number, or the underscore. Can't use any other character, including spaces.

3. Variables names are case sensative.

4. No limit to the length of the variable name.

5. You can't use one of JavaScript's reserved words as a variable name.
