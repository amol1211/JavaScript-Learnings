1. What's the difference between null and undefined?

var iAmUseless = null;
console.log(iAmUseless); // output : null

var iAmStandBy;
console.log(iAmStandBy); // output : undefined

undefined is also a datatype and (It's actually a bug)null's datatype is object.

2. What's NaN ?

console.log("Amol" - "Shinde"); // output : NaN

var result = 10 / "abc";
console.log(result);  // Output: NaN


NaN stands for "Not a Number." It is a special value that represents the result of an operation that cannot produce a meaningful numeric result.

NaN is property of global object. In other words, it is a variable in global scope. 

3. What is the difference between "function parameter" Vs "function Arguments" ?

Function Parameters:

Parameters are variables listed in the function declaration.
They act as placeholders or names for values that will be provided as arguments when the function is called.
Parameters are part of the function signature and are defined when the function is declared.
They are used within the function body to represent the values passed as arguments during the function call.

Example:

function addNumbers(a, b) {
    // a and b are parameters
    return a + b;
}

In this example, a and b are parameters of the addNumbers function.

Function Arguments:

Arguments are the actual values passed to a function when it is called.
They are provided in the function call and correspond to the parameters of the function.
The values passed as arguments are assigned to the parameters in the order in which they appear in the function declaration.

Example:

var result = addNumbers(2, 3);

In this example, 2 and 3 are arguments passed to the addNumbers function. During the function call, 
these values are assigned to the parameters a and b respectively.
