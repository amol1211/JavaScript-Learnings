1. What's the difference between null and undefined?

var iAmUseless = null;
console.log(iAmUseless); // output : null

var iAmStandBy;
console.log(iAmStandBy); // output : undefined

undefined is also a datatype and (It's actually a bug)null's datatype is object.

2. What's NaN ?

console.log("Amol" - "Shinde"); // output : NaN

var result = 10 / "abc";
console.log(result);  // Output: NaN


NaN stands for "Not a Number." It is a special value that represents the result of an operation that cannot produce a meaningful numeric result.

NaN is property of global object. In other words, it is a variable in global scope.
